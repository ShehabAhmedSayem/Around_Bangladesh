# Around Bangladesh

A website made with raw php and mysql database. It is mainly a helpful guide for tour loving people who want to explore the beauty of Bangladesh. 

## Description

We live in the most beautiful country of the world. We have lots of tourist spots where we can spend our leisure time for refreshment.
This project is about to help people traveling places .It is a very bad idea to start a journey without knowing anything about that place. 
It is also very difficult to gather all data about that place from internet cause we canâ€™t get authentic data about how to reach there 
and how much will it cost to visit any of these places, it is also very necessary to know the route and transport to get there 
which we want to provide in this project.
